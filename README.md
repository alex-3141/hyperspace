# Noita 3D SDF PoC

This is not a complete mod, and is a proof of concept for rendering 3D objects and projecting the game texture onto a 3D surface.

This was intended to be a submission to the 2025 Noita mod jam, but the scope was too large to be completed on time. Only the basic mechanics were done in time.

As a proof of concept, many modding best practices have been ignored for the sake of speed and simplicity and this will likely not be compatabile with other mods.
